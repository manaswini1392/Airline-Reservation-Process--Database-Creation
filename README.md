# Airline-Reservation-Process--Database-Creation
Airline reservation were done previously through agents where ticket bookig was very tedious job to stand in lines. To over come this traditional process we developed an end to end online business model and database for the airline reservation process. Developed the database in SQL developer and AS-IS and TO Be models.
